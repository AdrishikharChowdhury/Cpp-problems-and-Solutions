## Example Problem and Solution

### Problem: **Find the Factorial of a Number**

**Description**: Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given positive integer.

**Input**: A positive integer `n`.

**Output**: Factorial of the number `n` (i.e., \( n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \ldots \times 1 \)).

**Solution**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1)
        return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

int main() {
    int num;
    cout << "Enter a positive integer: ";
    cin >> num;

    if (num < 0) {
        cout << "Factorial is not defined for negative numbers." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is " << factorial(num) << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
